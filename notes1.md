# Datastructures
1. Arrays and lists: most common datastructures
2. Stacks and queues: more complex list-like datastructures
3. Linked lists: how they overcome shortcomings of arrays
4. Dictionaries: storing data as key-value pairs
5. Sets: useful for storing unique elements that appear only once
6. Binary Trees: storing data in a hierachial manner
7. Graphs and graph algorithms: ideal for modeling networks
